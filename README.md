Title: SYNK into aespa

Description: It is a website dedicated to aespa, a k-pop girl group by SM Entertainment. Aespa has a futuristic concept and their songs follow the girls’ lives in the SM Culture Universe, a fictional alternate universe created by SM Entertainment. The website will be focused on the lore and world-building by SM Entertainment but the group’s discography and their actual real-life information will still be included in the website.

Outline: The home page will have the general description of aespa and the synopsis of their lore.  
Subpages:
1. Discography - will contain information to the albums and the solo songs
2. Episode List - will contain the links to the episodes and a general description for each episode
3-6. Members - each member will have their own sub-page. The sub-pages will contain the members’ information both in real life and in the SM Culture Universe.
